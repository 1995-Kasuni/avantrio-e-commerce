1. System Architecture:
•	Describe whether you would choose a monolithic or microservices-based architecture and why.
I suggest a microservices-based architecture, hence this type of architecture will help to do the micro project handling and easy to handle the code.

Can you high performance services.

2. Database Design:
•	Which type of database (SQL or NoSQL) would you choose?
I reckon using a NoSQL database would more easier to handle the data load of a e-commerce site.

3. Rendering Approach:
•	Would you go with server-side rendering (SSR) or a separate frontend-backend architecture? Explain your decision.

server-side rendering (SSR)  - is suggesting for key pages
separate frontend-backend architecture – is suggesting for frontend-backend architecture

There can be pros and corns on both sides.

server-side rendering (SSR) 


separate frontend-backend architecture 
Can clearly manage both backend and frontend separately and there will be no dependencies.


4. Technology Stack:
•	Which frontend technology would you choose, and why (e.g., React, Vue, etc.)?
•	Which backend technology would you choose, (e.g., C# & .net,  Node & Express, Python & Django, Java & SpringBoot), and why?
We can use React with Node.js 
- Performance and SEO 
- Easy to understand the code and easy to refactor
- Reusable
- Flexible 

Backend .NET C#/ SpringBoot
- Can manage as a micro service
- Easy to maintain pipeline CI/CD using Azure
- Easy to do the testing (unit test)
- Security Compliance

5. Cloud Infrastructure:
•	Which cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) and services would you use to deploy your platform, and why?
AWS would be more scalable and have more features of ML/AI 
DevOps -CI/CD tools integration is easy 

6. Scalability:
•	How would you design the system to handle a significant increase in traffic (e.g., Black Friday)?
Key feature to have the elastic scalability, for that we can implement caching layers and Queue  (SQS) scales.
